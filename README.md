# Hoshruba-OOP_Project
A turn-based, strategy war game developed using C++ and SDL2.

This project was developed as a part of my Object Oriented Programming course. The final demo for the project can be found on: https://youtu.be/bUN36ey73Uo

There is also a GAME EXE zip folder uploaded to the repository. You may download that directly and run the .exe file within it to play the game in all its glory. 

However, note that you will need to have SDL2 setup on your device in order to play the game. The attached Project Guide file outlines the process for setting up SDL and provides a brief introduction to how it works.
